# Badges v1.5 - Referral System

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

We need to expand the badge system to include a comprehensive referral program that incentivizes users to invite friends and family to join the platform. The referral system should reward both the referrer and referred users, track completion requirements, and build a community-driven growth mechanism.

### Goals and Success Metrics

**Primary Goals:**
- Increase user acquisition through organic referrals by 200%
- Build a community of engaged financial learners
- Reward users for successful friend onboarding
- Create viral growth loops through friend completion tracking

**Success Metrics:**
- Referral conversion rate > 15%
- Friend completion rate > 60% (friends who complete required lessons)
- Referral badge completion rate > 40%
- User lifetime value increase of 35% for referred users

## Dependencies and Assumptions

**External Dependencies:**
- User registration and authentication system
- Email/SMS notification system for referral invitations
- Lesson completion tracking for referred friends
- Unique referral link generation service
- Dosh reward distribution system

**Key Assumptions:**
- Users are motivated to invite friends for financial rewards
- Friends are more likely to complete lessons when invited by someone they know
- Referral links can be tracked reliably across platforms
- Users will share referral links through various channels (social media, messaging)

## Technical Overview

### Data Model

**Referral Configuration:**
```typescript

  referralsRequired: number
  referralReward?: {
    doshReward: number
  }
  requiresFriendCompletion: boolean
  friendLessonsRequired?: number
  generateLink: boolean
}
```

**Referral Progress Tracking:**
```typescript
interface ReferralProgress {
  userId: string
  badgeId: string
  referralLink: string
  referrals: ReferralRecord[]
  totalReferrals: number
  completedReferrals: number
}

interface ReferralRecord {
  id: string
  referredUserId: string
  referredUserEmail?: string
  referredDate: string
  friendCompletedLessons: number
  friendMeetsRequirement: boolean
  earnedDate?: string
}
```

**Badge Integration:**
```typescript
// Extends existing Badge interface
interface Badge {
  // ... existing properties
  actionType: 'referral' // New action type
  progress?: number // Number of successful referrals
  totalRequired?: number // Total referrals needed
}
```

### Architecture

**Frontend Components:**
- `ReferralProgress`: Referral tracking dashboard
- `ReferralLinkGenerator`: Link creation and sharing interface
- `FriendCompletionTracker`: Friend progress visualization
- `ReferralBadgeCard`: Specialized badge display for referrals

**Backend Services:**
- Referral link generation and validation
- Friend registration attribution

**Integration Points:**

- Lesson management for completion validation
- Notification system for referral updates
- Analytics system for referral performance

## Considerations

### Open Questions

1. **Friend Verification**: How do we prevent fake friend registrations?
2. **Completion Timeframes**: Should friends have deadlines to complete lessons?
3. **Referral Limits**: Should there be maximum referrals per user to prevent abuse?
4. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: How do we track referrals across web, mobile, and email?
5. **Friend Rewards**: Should referred friends receive immediate rewards for signing up?

### Proposed Solutions

**Anti-Fraud Measures:**
- Email/phone verification for referred friends
- IP address and device fingerprinting
- Manual review for high-volume referrers
- Lesson engagement quality checks

**Friend Engagement:**
- Welcome bonus for referred friends
- Dedicated onboarding flow for referrals
- Referrer can see friend progress (with permission)
- Gentle reminders and encouragement system

**Attribution Accuracy:**
- Multiple tracking methods (cookies, URL parameters, user input)
- Fallback attribution for failed tracking
- Manual attribution request system
- Analytics dashboard for attribution verification

**Scalable Reward System:**
- Batch processing for reward distribution
- Configurable reward schedules
- Automatic fraud detection and holds
- Reward audit trail and reporting

### Out of Scope

- Advanced referral analytics and cohort analysis
- Social media integration for automatic sharing
- Referral leaderboards and competitions
- Multi-level marketing (MLM) style referral chains
- Corporate or bulk referral programs
- Integration with external affiliate networks
